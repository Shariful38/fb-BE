# fb-BE
fb-BE is a Python-based version of Bootstrap Embedding (BE) for fermion–boson lattice systems that are strongly correlated.The framework allows for scalable simulations of electron-phonon systems by partitioning the whole lattice into overlapping fragments. It focuses on the Hubbard–Holstein model.
